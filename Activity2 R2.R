#1. Create a vector using : operator

# A. a. Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.

y <- (-5:5)
y

#b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?

x <- 1:7
x

#2.* Create a vector using seq() function
#a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
#Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.

l <- seq (1, 3, by = 0.2)
l

#3. A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following
#list shows their ages: 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
#22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35,
#24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26,
#18.

#a. Access 3rd element, what is the value?
workers_age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,

                 18)

workers_age[3]

#b. Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?

workers_age[2]
workers_age[4]

#C. Access all but the 1st element is not included. Write the R code and its output.

workers_age[2:49]

#4. *Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector,
#names(x).

x <- c("first"=3, "second"=3, "third"=9)
names(x)

#5. Create a sequence x from -3:2.

x <- -3:2
x

x[2] <- 0
x

#6. The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.
#a.	Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php) and purchase-quantity (liter). Write the codes.

month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "June")
price_per_liter <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
purchase_quantity <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)

frame <- data.frame(month, price_per_liter, purchase_quantity)
frame

#b.	What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from Jan to June? Note: Use weighted.mean(liter, purchase)

weighted.mean(price_per_liter, purchase_quantity)


#7. R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths
#a.
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
          sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
data

#b. What are the results?

#8.	The table below gives the 25 most powerful celebrities and their annual pay as ranked by the editions of Forbes magazine and as listed on the Forbes.com website.

#a.	Create vectors according to the above table. Write the codes.
