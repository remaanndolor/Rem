#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.

LETTERS[seq(1, 26, 2)]

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels.

#2. a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

#b.  The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
#Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what
#is in the instruction.

#d. What will be the R code if you want to display the column 3 and column 4 in row 1
#and row 2? What is its output?

m[1, 3] 
m[2, 4]  

#e. What is the R code if you want to display only the columns 
# in 2 and 3, row 3? What is its output?

#f. What is the R code if you want to display only the columns 4?
# What is its output?

#g. Name the rows as isa, dalawa, tatlo and columns as uno, dos, tres,
# quatro for the matrix that was created in b. What is its R code and 
# corresponding output?

#h. From the original matrix you have created in a, reshape the matrix by assigning a
#new dimension with dim(). New dimensions should have 2 columns and 6 rows. What will
#be the R code and its output?

#3. An array contains 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1
#a. Create an array for the above values.Each values will be repeated twice
#What will be the R code if you are to create a three-dimensional array with 4 columns and 2
#rows. What will be its output?

#b. How many dimensions do your array have?

#answer: 3

#c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from
#the A. The array names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimentional Array”, and
#“3rd-Dimensional Array”. What will be the R codes and its output?
